Wireless Sensor Network Coordinator
===================================
This project code outlines a **Python 3** coordinator used in an *XBee* wireless network. The program is to be run on a *Raspberry Pi* ***2*** with 4 cores, taking advantage of the 4 cores using *MPI* with the **mpi4py** module.

Since this is a seminar project of the *TU Berlin*, emphasis is not given to functionality, but rather to prototyping. The program is linked strongly to the *Arduino* based sensors used. It can be adapted for other uses but will **not work** as is!
